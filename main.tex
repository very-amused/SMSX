\section{Goals of this Document}
This document was written to provide a standard for the usage and development of client-side state management that follows three central principles:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Efficiency: State management code written following this standard and its best practices will be efficient with its usage of available computer resources.
    \item Predictability: State management code written following this standard will be predictable and therefore easier to troubleshoot.
    \item Ease of Understanding: Code written following this standard will be understood with relative ease by other programmers that read and understand this standard.
\end{enumerate}
These principles were established as both a grading system for quality of a state management system, and an enumeration of the three biggest challenges when writing state management code. Following this standard is recommended for anyone working with unopinionated state management tools, such as Redux, Vuex, and Svelte, in order to write more consistent code that follows the principles stated above.

\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Interpretation}
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. The JSON format is to be be interpreted according to living IETF standard 90.

\subsection{Terminology}
In this document, these terms will be used repeatedly to refer to specific concepts. These concepts are not specific to language, framework, and implementation, although examples will be provided using JavaScript and Svelte.

\textbf{Map} refers to a data structure that meets the following requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Contains a key-value system for accessing child members.
    \item Only contains keys that are UTF-8 encoded strings.
    \item Can be exported as a JSON encoded string with the use of no more than two transformations.
\end{enumerate}
Language specific types that meet this definition include JavaScript's \emph{Object}, Go's \emph{Struct} and \emph{Map}, and Python's \emph{Dict}. Child members of maps will be referred to as \emph{properties} for the purpose of this document.

\textbf{ID} refers to a unique \emph{string} that is used to identify a resource.

\textbf{Resource} refers to a data structure that can be accessed by a unique identifier (ID). \textbf{Store} refers to a map containing similar resources keyed by ID. A store used to manage a singular resource or piece of state (i.e user authentication/identity) is only managed by the section on single resource stores. The rest of this standard does not apply.

A state is composed of as many stores as needed, which are composed of many resources. \textbf{State} refers to the relevant data needed to ensure correct and accurate operation of any program, composed of one or more stores.

\textbf{Parent data source} refers to any source of data that a store MUST be able to both read and write to. Examples of this include localstorage, IndexedDB, CRUD capable APIs, and JSON/CSV files. If a parent data source contains encrypted data, it SHOULD provide clients with checksums of the encrypted data, so that the client may avoid wasteful decryption operations if the data has not changed from a cached version.

\textbf{Volatile store} refers to any store that operates independently of any other data source, and consequently results in the loss of any data contained in the store when it is removed from memory. \textbf{Nonvolatile store} refers to any store that operates dependently on another data source. A nonvolatile store MUST use the commit method outlined in subsection 4.4 to save data to its parent data source. A nonvolatile store's data source SHOULD be nonvolatile in itself, meaning that it is not entirely stored in memory.

\textbf{Passing} refers to when a method returns as soon as available, without performing any interactions or operations on any data or throwing/returning any form of error.

\section{Resource \& Store Structure}

\subsection{Resource Structure}
Each resource MUST be a map. A resource MAY include properties that cannot be exported as JSON without the loss of information. An example of this is that a resource may include a CryptoKey object, which will be exported as \verb|[object Object]|.

Each resource MUST have a unique resource identifier (ID). This ID MAY be included as a property of the resource. This ID MAY be generated within the store itself or by a parent data source. This ID SHOULD NOT be enumerated, a random number generator SHOULD be used to obtain this ID, and its uniqueness within the resource's parent store MUST be guaranteed, regardless of how/where it was generated. This ID MUST be included as a key used to access the resource from its parent store.

Resources SHOULD NOT contain maps with subproperties. If a parent data source returns a map with multiple depths, the store SHOULD flatten all properties needed into a single map before storage or returning any information.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Valid Resource Structure]
// Allowed
'123': { // Where '123' is a unique ID
    title: String,
    description: String,
    key: CryptoKey
}
'123': {
    title: String,
    description: String,
    key: CryptoKey,
    id: '123'
}

// Allowed, but not recommended
'123': {
    title: String,
    description: String,
    meta: {
        key: CryptoKey
    }
}

// Disallowed
true: {
}
'123': {
    wrongMember: '123'
}
'123': []
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Single Resource Stores}
Not all stores are used to manage multiple resources by ID. Sometimes, a store is necessary simply to manage a single resource or piece of state, this is referred to as a \textbf{single resource store}. A common example of this is that a store may be used to tell components of a program if a user is authenticated. \textbf{\textit{The only requirement of a store of this nature is that the data component is a map.}} No other guidelines or requirements outlined in this standard need to be followed for a single resource store. Greater freedom is granted to the programmer for single resource stores, as their functionality and design can vary greatly by their function in a program.

\subsection{Store Structure}

Henceforth, a store will be referred to as three components: data, methods, and reactivity. A store's data refers to the underlying state that the store is used to access and subscribe to. A store's methods refer to callable code that is used to modify a store's data. A store's reactivity refer to any internal components of a store that are used to notify subscribers when a method changes data.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Data, Reactivity, and Methods}]
import { writable } from 'svelte/store'

function create() {
    const users = {} // Data
    const { subscribe, update } = writable(users)
    
    return {
        subscribe, // Reactivity
        // Methods
    }
}

// Since there are no derived stores from the users stores,
// allowing for named imports is not required, but it is still best practice
export const users = create()

export default users
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Store Data}
A store's data MUST be a valid data structure. Each key MUST be an ID that corresponds to a resource, each key MUST be accurate to the resource it is used to access. A store MUST NOT contain any additional keys.

\subsection{Store Methods}
A store MUST contain the methods defined in subsection 4.1. These methods MUST behave as defined in subsection 4.2. A store MAY contain a method (private or public) that is called to subscribe a point of access to changes in the store's data. Once a client is subscribed, the client MUST be notified when any method that manipulates relevant data is called. A compiler MAY surgically transform subscriptions so that clients are only notified of the information that they access during their memory scope. A runtime MUST NOT emulate this behavior.

\subsection{Store Reactivity}
A store MAY contain reactivity, a mostly invisible component dedicated to allowing points of access (clients) to "subscribe" to the store, and notifying these clients when a change is made. A store's reactivity MUST notify any subscribers when the store's data is updated using a method. A store's reactivity MAY notify any subscribers when the store's data is updated without the usage of a method. Clients SHOULD NOT rely that a store will notify them when data is updated without the use of a method.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Method Behavior}
Any method of a store, whether the method is required by this standard or custom, must adhere to and not conflict with the behavior defined in this section. A method MUST NOT be assumed to succeed. A method MUST either throw or return any relevant errors.

In languages that support async/await syntax, any method of a store that accesses async functionality (calls any function that is declared as async or returns a promise) MUST be declared as async. This is to ensure that any rejected promises are properly passed upstream so that they may be handled. Any event driven API accessed within a method MUST be either wrapped as a promise and awaited, or have an event listener placed on the error event to throw an error, therefore rejecting the method itself. If the event provides an error, the method MUST NOT intercept or alter this error in any way.

If a method accepts an ID as a parameter, the method MUST verify if the ID actually refers to a resource belonging to the same store as the method being called before performing any interactions/operations. A method MUST throw/return an error of an ID is passed that does not match a resource belonging to the store from which the method is being called. If no ID is passed, the method MUST throw an error. 

If a method accepts a map as a parameter in a non-typesafe language, the method SHOULD validate the type and structure according to the three requirements outlined in subsection 2.2. A method MAY choose to perform additional custom validation according to a custom schema. If any validation fails, the method MUST throw/return an error.

Methods MUST NOT specify default values for any arguments, as this would result in less specificity required for a successful call to the method, and therefore less predictable behavior. 

If a method performs interactions with a parent data source, the method MUST either return all data passed down from the parent data source, or update the relevant resource to contain this information. These two options MAY be combined (some information passed down from a parent source may be added to the resource, and some may be returned, as long as no data is ignored). If the parent data source returns any data calculated based on a request made during the method's calling (i.e checksums), the method MUST either update the value of the resource specified to contain that data, or return a valid data structure containing the data returned by the parent data source. A method MUST NOT ignore ANY data returned by a parent data source.

A method MUST throw/return an error if interacting with a parent data source fails in any way. If this error is passed down from the parent data source, the method MUST NOT intercept or alter this error in any way. A method MUST account for the case of being unable to parse an error from the parent data source, providing a fallback error to throw/return if this does occur. This error SHOULD contain a level of verbosity that describes what stage of the method failed at minimum.

\subsection{Required Methods}
A store MUST contain the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|create(data): { id }|
    \item \verb|update(id, data): void|
    \item \verb|delete(id): void|
\end{itemize}
\newpage
If a store is classified as nonvolatile, it MUST contain the following methods in addition to the methods required above:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|init(): void|
    \item \begin{verbatim}commit(id): { calculatedData } | void\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}

The names of the methods shown above are REQUIRED and RESERVED. The names of arguments shown above are NOT REQUIRED.

These methods MUST behave as outlined in the following subsections. Any other methods MAY be created to behave as desired by the programmer, as long as this behavior includes and does not conflict with the behavior defined in the following subsection.

\subsection{Creating a New Resource}
A store MUST contain a method to create a new resource. This method MUST be named \verb|create|.

This method MUST accept one argument, this argument being a valid data structure. This data structure SHOULD contain all information available about the resource being created. This method MAY choose to validate the data structure before performing any operations, and throw/return an error if validation is unsuccessful.

This method MUST ensure that the creation of the resource is successfully performed upstream by any parent data source(s) before performing the creation within the store. This method MUST return a map containing at least a member named \verb|id|, containing the resource's created ID. Regarding additional members, this method must adhere to subsection 4.2, paragraphs 4-5.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Create Method]
async create(data) {
    const validated = customValidator(data)
    if (!validated) {
        throw new Error('Bad data supplied')
    }
    
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/resources', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    }
    const body = await res.json()
    if (!res.status === 201) {
        throw new Error(body.message || `Failed to create resource (status ${res.status}`)
    }
    
    update((store) => {
        store[body.id] = { ...data, id: body.id, checksum: body.checksum }
    })
    
    return {
        id: body.id,
        checksum: body.checksum
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Updating an Existing Resource}
A store MUST contain a method to update an existing resource. This method MUST be named \verb|update|.

This method MUST accept two arguments, the first argument being the ID of the resource being updated, and the second argument being a valid data structure containing the data to update the resource with.

This method MUST treat omitted child members as containing their last known value. This method MUST NOT treat omitted child members as containing empty, null, or undefined values. This method MUST update ONLY the resource specified by ID in the first parameter, using the data specified in the second parameter.

This method MAY choose to immediately commit the updated resource after the update is complete. If this behavior is desired, the commit method MUST be called using the same ID that was passed to this method. If the commit method is declared as async or returns a promise, the update method MUST be declared as async, and the commit method MUST be awaited. This method MUST NOT emulate the commit method within its own code. Whether or not a store should choose to commit each update SHOULD be decided based on how frequently it updated, whether there are multiple triggers for updates and commits (i.e triggering an update on input, and a commit on blur), and what is deemed to strike an appropriate balance between simplicity of implementation and performance for end users.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Update Method]
update(id, data) {
    // Looks weird, but namespacing is a beautiful thing
    update((store) => {
        store[id] = { ...store[id], ...data } // Retain any properties not updated in the data passed
    })
    await this.commit(id) // Not required
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Deleting an Existing Resource}
A store MUST contain a method to delete an existing resource. This method MUST be named \verb|delete|.

This method MUST accept one argument, this argument being the ID of the resource to be deleted.

This method MUST ensure that the deletion of the resource is performed upstream by any parent data source(s) before deleting it from the local store. If any step of the deletion fails, this method MAY choose to throw an error or fail silently. If the upstream deletion of the resource fails, this method MUST fail silently or loudly without making any changes to the store. Whether this method should fail silently or loudly SHOULD be decided based on whether a handler is available for the event of an error.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Delete Method]
async delete(id) {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/resources' + id, {
        method: 'DELETE'
    })
    if (res.status !== 204) {
        // There will only be a body if there's an error message to give in this case
        const body = await res.json() 
        throw new Error(body.message || 'Deletion from API failed')
        // This method can choose to fail silently
        return
    }

    update((store) => {
        delete store[id]
        return store
    })
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Initialization}
If a store is nonvolatile, it MUST contain a method to initialize itself from its parent data source(s). This method MUST be named \verb|init|.

This method MUST accept no arguments and return no value (except for an error if applicable).

If data returned from a parent data source is encrypted, this method is where the store SHOULD use checksums to compare the version of encrypted data retrieved to a decrypted cached version. More detail regarding caching is available in section 6.

If the store is nonvolatile, it MAY omit the initialization method. If a store is nonvolatile and chooses not to omit the initialization method, the method MUST pass.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Initialization Method]
async init() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/resources', {
        method: 'GET'
    })
    const body = await res.json()
    
    for (const resource of body) {
        update((store) => {
            store[resource.id] = resource
            return store
        })
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Committing to a Parent Data Source}
\label{commit}
If a store is nonvolatile, it MUST contain a method to commit an updated resource to its parent data source. This method MUST be named \verb|commit|. 

This method MUST accept one argument, this argument being the ID of the resource being committed.

This method MUST ensure that any and all parent data sources are updated to contain the updated version of the resource before making any changes to the store.

If a store is volatile, it MAY omit the commit method. If a store is nonvolatile and chooses not to omit the commit method, the method MUST pass.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Commit Method]
async commit(id) {
    const resources = get(resourceStore)
    if (!resources[id]) {
        throw new Error('Invalid ID')
    }
    const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/${resource.id}`, {
        method: 'PATCH',
        body: JSON.stringify(resources[id])
    })
    const body = await res.json()
    if (res.status !== 200) {
        throw new Error(body.message || `Failed to commit changes to API (status ${res.status})`)
    }
    update((store) => {
        store[id].checksum = body.meta.checksum
    })
    // OR
    return {
        checksum: body.meta.checksum
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Derivation \& Exports}
Note: this section is only applicable to state management systems which implement derivation at the \emph{store level}.

\subsection{Allowance}
A store MAY implement derivations/computations of itself. Unlike regular stores, derived stores are NOT REQUIRED to be a valid data structure. In fact, a primary use case of derived stores is to transform a store from a valid data structure to another format (such as an array). If a derived store is not in the format of a valid data structure, it MUST adhere to the guidelines of subsection 5.2. A derived store SHOULD be declared in the same file in which the parent store is declared.

\subsection{Alternate Data Structures}
A common use case for derived stores is converting a store into a different data structure for purposes of iteration, display to end users, debugging, etc. If a derived store is not a valid data structure, and contains multiple resources, it must obey the following guidelines:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Each resource MUST be kept separate by means which the language parser used will understand (no custom separators). A resource's properties MAY be kept separate, but this is NOT REQUIRED.
    \item Each resource's ID MUST be preserved as a child member named \verb|id| (post standard parsing if applicable).
    \item When a resource is retrieved by means of iteration, its ID MUST be retrievable as specified in guideline \#2, and the ID retrieved MUST be usable to access the resource in the parent store.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Derived Store as Array]
// Allowed
[
    {
        id: '1234',
        title: 'atitle',
        description: 'adescription'
    }
]
// JavaScript can parse JSON without any special/unstandard logic, so this is still valid separation.
'[{"id":"1234","title":"atitle","description":"adescription"}]'
[
    id: '1234',
    titleAndDescription: 'atitle-adescription'
]



// Disallowed
// Violation of guideline #1
['1234,5678,9101112', 'onetitle,twotitle,threetitle', 'adescription,anotherdescription']
[
    ['1234', 'atitle', 'description'] // Violation of guideline #2
]
[
    {
        // Violation of guideline #3
        id: 'm', // ID is encoded differently from the parent store
        title: 'atitle',
        description: 'adescription'
    }
]
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Exports}
If a derived store is declared in the same file as its parent store, this file MUST utilize named exports for each store (including the parent store). This file MAY still specify a default export, this SHOULD be the parent store for semantic purposes, but it MAY be any store declared and exported in the file. If a file declares a default export, it MUST be declared as the last export in the file, below all other exports.

\subsubsection{Create Functions}
A create function is defined as any function that creates a store, and will not return an already existing store if called again. Any function that meets this definition MUST NOT be called more than once during the lifetime of the program. If a file contains named exports and a default export, the default export MUST be set to a variable already exported as a named export, it MUST NOT call a create function again. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Usage of Create Functions and Named Exports]
// Allowed
export const resources = create()
export const derivedResources = createDerived()

export const resources = create()
export const derivedResources = createDerived()
export default resources

// Allowed, but semantically flawed
export const resources = create()
export const derivedResources = createDerived()
export default derivedResources

// Disallowed
export const resources = create()
export const derivedResources = createDerived()
export default create()
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Caching of Encrypted Resources}
This section contains guidelines for the handling of zero-access encryption in compliance with this standard.

\subsection{Overview}
Decrypting information on the client-side requires a nontrivial amount of resources and time, and SHOULD be minimized as much as possible. In order to accomplish this, checksums SHOULD be used in a specific way to ensure that store methods avoid decrypting information that it already has a copy of.

\subsection{Calculating Checksums}
Checksums MUST be taken from resources on the server-side, before being sent to the client. This is both an additional effort towards minimizing client resource usage, and a preventative measure against errors/inconsistencies in client code for taking checksums. Checksums MUST be taken of the encrypted form of a resource, NOT the decrypted form, as this would undermine the entire point of avoiding unnecessary decryption operations. The checksum MUST be taken from a BINARY, CONCATENATED form of the resource being retrieved. If the resource is stored in binary and then converted to another format before being sent to the user (such as hex or base64), all properties MUST be concatenated while still in binary form. The concatenation order of these properties does not matter, as long as it is consistent between each time a checksum for the resource is calculated. Each time the checksum is calculated for a resource, it MUST be identical, unless the resource itself has changed.

\subsection{Checksum Algorithms}
The hash used to calculate checksums DOES NOT need to be cryptographically secure, as it is only ever taken of data that is already encrypted, so if the hash function were reversed, this would be harmless. While security is not an important function of this hash, speed is. Older, faster hashes such as MD5 and SHA-1 are preferred to newer hashes that provide greater security at the cost of speed.

\subsection{Cached Storage}
When storing a nontrivial amount of data, it is important that clients have a fast, indexed method of storage and retrieval. On the web, this standard encourages the usage of IndexedDB, NOT localstorage for storing cached resources and checksums.

\subsection{Applying Checksums during Initialization}
A client SHOULD perform logic to avoid unnecessary decryption during a store's \verb|init| method as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The resource is retrieved from a parent data source, the retrieved data includes a checksum for the resource's encrypted form.
    \item The client tries to retrieve a cached copy of the resource from its cache.
    \item If retrieving a cached copy of the resource fails, the client decrypts the resource, and stores it along with its checksum in the cache.
    \item If a cached copy is retrieved, the client compares the checksum of the cached copy with the checksum retrieved from the parent data source.
    \item If the two checksums match, the client knows that the resource has not changed, and does not decrypt the information.
    \item If the two checksums do not match, the client knows that the resource has updated, decrypts the information, updates its cache to contain the updated data and checksum.
    \item Finally, now that the cache has been synchronized with the parent data source, each resource in the cache is added to the store.
\end{enumerate}
This logic DOES NOT alter or otherwise take precedent over the required methods for updating application state specified in section 4, it simply provides a design pattern to greatly speed up the \verb|init| method when dealing with encrypted data.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Retrieving Encrypted Resources]
async init() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/resources', {
        method: 'GET'
    })
    const body = await res.json()
    
    // In real code, this should be wrapped as a promise
    const req = someIDBstore.getAll()
    
    req.addEventListever('error', () => {
        throw req.error // This may be wrapped in an Error constructor if a linter/formatter demands so
    })
    req.addEventListener('success', () => {
        const cache = req.result // Produces an array of all cached resources
        
        // First, clear any resources that don't exist anymore
        for (const resource of cache) {
            if (!body.find(r => r.id === resource.id)) {
                someIDBstore.delete(resource.id)
            }
        }
        
        // Apply the logic explained above to avoid unnecessary decryption
        for (const resource of body) {
            // If there is a cached copy of the resource
            const cached = cache.find(r => r.id === resource.id)
            if (cached) {
                // And the checksum matches the one returned from the API call
                if (cached.checksum === resource.meta.checksum) {
                    // Skip decryption and continue onto the next resource
                    continue
                }
            }
            
            // At this point, we can decrypt knowing that it isn't a wasteful operation
            const decrypted = await someDecyptFunction(resource, someKey)
            
            // Add decrypted + checksum to cache using a PUT method to overwrite any data that was already there under the ID
            // (this code is omitted here because it's very resource-specific)
        }
        
        // Now we know that our cache is up to date, so we retrieve all results again and add each resource to the store
        const newReq = someIDBstore.getAll()
        
        newReq.addEventListever('error', () => {
                throw newReq.error
        })
